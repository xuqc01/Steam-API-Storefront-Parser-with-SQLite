# Steam-API-Storefront-Web-Sraping with SQLite

# About
This project scrapes video game data (app id, cost, release dates, active player count, etc.) from Steam's API and Steam Spy's API through HTTP requests. Steam Spy's API was accessed in addition to Steam's own API because player-generated tags for these games are not easily accessible through Steam. The purpose of this project is to reveal which genre of video games is currently the most popular as of March of 2023. The generic 'genre' and 'category' descriptions that Steam provides for their own video games did not suffice because they provided little information on the actual styling or were so broad that a large majority of games fit into that category.

Software Requirements
